The Great Depression that had begun with the stock market crash of 1929 was now at its worst. But what struck Roosevelt was not the actual economic factors but the mood of the public. It seemed to him that people were not only more fearful than necessary but that their fears were making it harder to surmount adversity\n\n\n\n\nFear creates its own self-fulfilling dynamic\u2014as people give in to it, they lose energy and momentum. Their lack of confidence translates into inaction that lowers confidence levels even further, on and on\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, first of all,\u201d he told the audience, \u201clet me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\u2014nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nYou can just as easily see a crisis or problem as a challenge, an opportunity to prove your mettle, the chance to strengthen and toughen yourself, or a call to collective action. By seeing it as a challenge, you will have converted this negative into a positive purely by a mental process that will result in positive action as well\n\n\n\n\nminorities\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand: we are all too afraid\u2014of offending people, of stirring up conflict, of standing out from the crowd, of taking bold action.",

It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper.\n\n\n\n\nThat's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space.\n\n\n\n\nEverybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n\n\n\n\n2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect:\n\n\n\n\n\"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that,\n\n\n\n\nor honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain't a killer but don't push me.\"\n\n\n\n\nThese days rappers will just tell you, \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n\n\n\nTo me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper\n\n\n\n\nYou can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse.\n\n\n\n\nHe wrote those lyrics without any music.\n\n\n\n\nThe thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.\n\n\n\n\nAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac.\n\n\n\n\nThe music was all that mattered\n\n\n\n\nThat East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef.\n\n\n\n\nNow that he's not here, he's bigger than ever.\n\n\n\n\nI can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\n\n\n\n\nLaurence Fishburne\n\n\n\n\nHe told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him.
